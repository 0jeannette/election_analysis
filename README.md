#Election_Analysis

#Project Overview

Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, has tasked us to complete an election audit using Python so the process can be automated for future election audits. We can assist Tom by providing him with the following:

1. Total number of votes
2. Number and % of votes per county
3. County with the most votes
4. Number and % of votes per candidate
5. Winner of election

#Election-Audit Summary

The script that was developed for the election audit has demonstrated its value in how quickly in can help us decipher election data. The script can be modified for additional analyses such as percentage of candidate votes by county. Additional data such as census data can be added to look closer at how population size relates to voter turn out.
